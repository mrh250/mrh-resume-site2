# Welcome to my resume!

I start from a [Template](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/resume/) from the good folks at StartBootstrap, and it is a resume and CV theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). This theme features a fixed sidebar with content sections to build a simple, yet elegant resume.
